斯坦福大学推荐的自然语言处理中一些有趣的论文  
在期末工程环节，斯坦福大学提供了一些有趣论文作为参考基点   
The choose-your-own final project lets you explore a task or research idea you are excited about. You can choose any topic related to deep learning for NLP. To be precise: That means that the project should make substantive use of deep learning and substative use of human language data.    
To inspire project ideas, here are some cool NLP papers:

    Attention is All You Need
    Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks
    Semi-supervised Sequence Learning
    A Joint Many-Task Model: Growing a Neural Network for Multiple NLP Tasks
    Semi-supervised sequence tagging with bidirectional language models
    Deep Biaffine Attention for Neural Dependency Parsing
    Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space
    Improving Neural Language Models with a Continuous Cache
    Reasoning about Entailment with Neural Attention
    Ultradense Word Embeddings by Orthogonal Transformation

And here are some NLP datasets:

    Kaggle Datasets
    Sequence Tagging: Named Entity Recognition and Chunking
    Dependency Parsing
    Quora Question Pairs
    Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis and Document-Level Sentiment Analysis
    Textual Entailment
    Machine Translation (Ambitious)
    Yelp Reviews
    WikiText Language Modeling
    Fake News Challenge
    Toxic Comment Classification
